// This file is obsolete - all DynamoDB operations should go through API routes

/*
 * DynamoDB Operations
 * 
 * These operations should be moved to API routes or server components.
 * For client-side use, create Next.js API routes that use these operations.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT:
 * - Never import AWS SDK or credentials in client components
 * - Always use Next.js API routes for AWS operations
 * - For more complex operations, use Lambda functions through API Gateway
